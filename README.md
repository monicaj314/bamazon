# bamazon

## Summary

This is a simple node app that accesses a MySQL database to retrieve and print a list of available products, product ids, and prices by running `bamazonCustomer.js`

User will be prompted to enter in a Product ID, then a quantity.
The app will check the stock quantity in the database and either inform the user there is insufficient stock, or calculate their order total, based on their input.
